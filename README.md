# Introduction
Elasticsearch is a search engine that is responsible for storing our logs and allowing for them to be queried. Fluentd sends log messages from Kubernetes to Elasticsearch, whereas Kibana is a graphical interface for viewing and querying the logs stored in Elasticsearch.
This stack is based on AWS Open Distro for Elasticsearch, a value-added distribution of Elasticsearch that is 100% open source (Apache 2.0 license) and supported by AWS. 
## Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is deployed as a StatefulSet, which is like a Deployment, but allows for maintaining state on storage volumes.
## Kibana
Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser-based analytics and search dashboard for Elasticsearch.
## Fluentd
Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet which spawns a pod on each node that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers and sends them to Elasticsearch.
