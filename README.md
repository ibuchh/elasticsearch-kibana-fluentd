# Introduction
Elasticsearch is a search engine that is responsible for storing our logs and allowing for them to be queried. Fluentd sends log messages from Kubernetes to Elasticsearch, whereas Kibana is a graphical interface for viewing and querying the logs stored in Elasticsearch.
## Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is deployed as a StatefulSet, which is like a Deployment, but allows for maintaining state on storage volumes.
## Kibana
Kibana is an open source (Apache Licensed), browser-based analytics and search dashboard for Elasticsearch.
## Fluentd
Fluentd is deployed as a DaemonSet which spawns a pod on each node that reads logs, generated by kubelet, container runtime and containers and sends them to Elasticsearch.
